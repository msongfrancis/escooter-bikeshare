Database Schema 
35/ 40
Great database schema. I just need the field types added to this for full points. This is really easy and clear to read and understand what is going on. I like the spatial join.

Create Table Statements

These are great
 

SQL Query 
40/40
Very good code. Really good use of code here. CTE and a subquery. 

WITH total_trips_weekday as
(
SELECT to_char(start_time, 'day') as trip_day,
COUNT(trip_id) as total
FROM niceride_starts
GROUP BY to_char(start_time, 'day')
)					 
SELECT a.trip_day, (a.total/b.total_trips::FLOAT)*100 as percent_usage					 
FROM total_trips_weekday a, 
	(
		SELECT COUNT(trip_id) as total_trips
		FROM niceride_starts
 	) as b
ORDER BY (a.total/b.total_trips::FLOAT)*100 DESC;

Don't use select *

Result & Challenges
20/20
So yes databases are very rigid in the names of columns so that can be really difficult. Glad you used another program like Python to modify the data. Pandas can load data directly into postgreSQL and Psycopg2 can do a lot of querying or you can do a query directly into a dataframe (pandas or geopandas).

Readability
10/10
