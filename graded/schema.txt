Most of your table and field names are appropriate. I would spend some time renaming them

"Nice rid trip data" --> nice_ride_trips
"start time" --> start_time

the field trip_id is nice and unique?
I would still expect to see a date in there. 
Why is "birth year" a field?

Do some work cleaning up the field name in ACS table and the Minneapolis streets table. 

You probably need to specify the joins. Census block groups don't join they spatial join to nice ride data.
